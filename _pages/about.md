My name is Binbin Wang. I obtained my Ph.D. in bioinformatics from Tongji University in July 2019. From March 2017 to March 2018, I worked as a visiting scholar at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Department of Data Sciences. 

My previous research is focusing on developing novel computational and genomics approaches to understand the function of the human genome, especially in the context of human physiology and disease. I have developed the MAGeCKFlute algorithm to process, analyze, and visualize CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening. MAGeCKFlute can be applied to remove batch effects, correct copy-number bias, identify screening hits, and perform downstream functional analysis for various CRISPR screens. For CRISPR screening samples that treated with a drug, MAGeCKFlute can also be used to identify drug-associated genes. I am also interested in cancer immunology, especially for the understanding of the interactions between cancer cells and immune cells.

In collaboration with researchers from Tongji University and DFCI, we systematically characterize the gene essentiality in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cell lines through genome-wide CRISPR screens. By integrating the expression data, ATAC-seq data, and CRISPR screen data, we identified key transcription factors that enabled resistance to BRAFi and the candidate therapeutic targets for BRAFi-resistant melanoma. We also designed a large-scale murine CRISPR knockout library (“MusCK”) and conducted an in vivo screen in two murine triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) models to identify genetic factors that regulate TNBC progression and response to PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade. Integration analysis of RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, mass spectrometry, and CRISPR screen data revealed novel regulators in the TNBC tumor immune microenvironment.
