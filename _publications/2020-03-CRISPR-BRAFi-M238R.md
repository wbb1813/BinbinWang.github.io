BRAF is a serine-threonine kinase that harbors activating mutations in ~7% of human malignancies and ~60% of melanomas. Despite initial clinical responses to BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi), patients frequently develop drug resistance. To identify candidate therapeutic targets for BRAFi resistant melanoma, we conduct CRISPR screens in melanoma cells harboring an activating BRAF mutation that had also acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor. To investigate the mechanisms and pathways enabling resistance to BRAFi in melanomas, we integrate expression, ATAC-seq, and CRISPR screen data. We identify the JUN family transcription factors and the ETS family transcription factor ETV5 as key regulators of CDK6, which together enabled resistance to BRAF inhibitor in melanoma cells. Our findings reveal genes contributing to resistance to a selective BRAF inhibitor PLX4720, providing new insights into gene regulation in BRAFi resistant melanoma cells.
