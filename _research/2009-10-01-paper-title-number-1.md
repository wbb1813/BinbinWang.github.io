excerpt: ' Developed the MAGeCKFlute algorithm to process, analyze and visualize CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening. MAGeCKFlute can be applied to remove batch effects, correct copy-number bias, identify screening hits and perform downstream functional analysis for various CRISPR screens. For CRISPR screening samples that treated with a drug, MAGeCKFlute can also be used to identify drug-associated genes.'
