## Algorithm development of CRISPR screen data analysis
- Developed the MAGeCKFlute algorithm to process, analyze and visualize CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening. MAGeCKFlute can be applied to remove batch effects, correct copy-number bias, identify screening hits and perform downstream functional analysis for various CRISPR screens. For CRISPR screening samples that treated with a drug, MAGeCKFlute can also be used to identify drug-associated genes.
-	Optimized gRNA pair design and analysis for knockout of drugable genes. A paired gRNA library was designed to target druggable genes to identify synergy gene pairs. Designed several customized sgRNA libraries in various systems.
-	Used genome-wide CRISPR screens to identify candidate therapeutic targets for BRAFi-resistant melanoma. Integration of expression data, ATAC-seq, and CRISPR screen results identified key transcription factors that enabled resistance to BRAFi in melanoma cells (collaboration). 
-	Designed a large-scale murine CRISPR knockout library (“MusCK”) and conducted an in vivo screen in two murine triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) models to identify genetic factors that regulate TNBC progression and response to PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade (in collaboration with Myles Brown lab at DFCI). Integrated RNA-seq data, ATAC-seq, mass spectrometry, and CRISPR screen data to identify novel regulators in the TNBC tumor immune microenvironment.
