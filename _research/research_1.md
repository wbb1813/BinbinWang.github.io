## Algorithm development of CRISPR screen data analysis

---

* Developed the MAGeCKFlute algorithm to process, analyze and visualize CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening. MAGeCKFlute can be applied to remove batch effects, correct copy-number bias, identify screening hits and perform downstream functional analysis for various CRISPR screens. For CRISPR screening samples that treated with a drug, MAGeCKFlute can also be used to identify drug-associated genes.

* Optimized gRNA pair design and analysis for knockout of drugable genes. A paired gRNA library was designed to target druggable genes to identify synergy gene pairs. Designed several customized sgRNA libraries in various systems.

* Used genome-wide CRISPR screens to identify candidate therapeutic targets for BRAFi-resistant melanoma. Integration of expression data, ATAC-seq, and CRISPR screen results identified key transcription factors that enabled resistance to BRAFi in melanoma cells (collaboration). 

* Designed a large-scale murine CRISPR knockout library (“MusCK”) and conducted an in vivo screen in two murine triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) models to identify genetic factors that regulate TNBC progression and response to PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade (in collaboration with Myles Brown lab at DFCI). Integrated RNA-seq data, ATAC-seq, mass spectrometry, and CRISPR screen data to identify novel regulators in the TNBC tumor immune microenvironment.

Computational characterization of T cell and B cell repertoire and cancer immunology

---

* Developed an algorithm to Identify neo-antigens using mutation and expression data to Identify and characterize neo-antigens of TCGA patients. 

* Assembled CDR3 regions of T cell and B cell from TCGA RNA-seq data using TRUST and characterized T cell and B repertoire at pan-cancer level. 

* Participate in the development of the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER; cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer) to comprehensively investigate the molecular characterization of tumor-immune interactions

Protein degradation and Ubiquitin-Proteasome System in Cancer

---

* Developed an algorithm to integrate mass spectrometry data and other multi-omics data.

* Revealed that a significant fraction of cancer driver genes impact the function of the UPS, and degron loss leads to up-regulated protein abundance.
